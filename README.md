### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deniz and I'm studied Computer Engineering at Ankara University. I'm currently trying improve myself on Software Development, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence technologies. I really enjoy learning languages like Java and Python and frameworks like Spring Boot and Flask, as well as working React. I also enjoy working with Database technologies.
